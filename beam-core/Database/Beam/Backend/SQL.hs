-- * MonadBeam class

-- | A class that ties together a Sql syntax, backend, handle, and monad type.
--
--   Intuitively, this allows you to write code that performs database commands
--   without having to know the underlying API. As long as you have an
--   appropriate handle from a database library that Beam can use, you can use
--   the 'MonadBeam' methods to execute the query.
--
--   Provided here is a low-level interface. Most often, you'll only need the
--   'withDatabase' and 'withDatabaseDebug' function. The 'run*' functions are
--   wrapped by the appropriate functions in "Database.Beam.Query".
--
--   This interface is very high-level and isn't meant to expose the full power
--   of the underlying database. Namely, it only supports simple data retrieval
--   strategies. More complicated strategies (for example, Postgres's @COPY@)
--   are supported in individual backends. See the documentation of those
--   backends for more details.

  -- | Run a database action, but don't report any debug information
  withDatabase = withDatabaseDebug (\_ -> pure ())

  -- | Run a query determined by the given syntax, providing an action that will
  --   be called to consume the results from the database (if any). The action
  --   will get a reader action that can be used to fetch the next row. When
  --   this reader action returns 'Nothing', there are no rows left to consume.
  --   When the reader action returns, the database result is freed.
