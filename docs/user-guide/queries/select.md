We've seen how to create simple queries from our schema. Beam supports other
clauses in the SQL SELECT statement.

For these examples, we're going to use the `beam-sqlite` backend with the
provided sample Chinook database. The Chinook database schema is modeled after a
fictional record store. It provides several tables containing information on the
music as well as the billing operations. Thus, it provides a good 'real-world'
demonstration of beam's capabalities.

First, create a SQLite database from the included example.

```console
$ sqlite3 chinook.db < beam-sqlite/examples/chinook.sql
```

Now, load the chinook database schema in GHCi.

```haskell
Prelude Database.Beam.Sqlite> :load beam-sqlite/examples/Chinook/Schema.hs
Prelude Chinook.Schema> chinook <- open "chinook.db"
```

One more thing, before we see more complex examples, let's define a quick
utility function.

```haskell
Prelude Chinook.Schema> let withConnectionTutorial = withDatabaseDebug putStrLn chinook
```

Let's test it!

We can run all our queries like:

```haskell
withConnectionTutorial $ runSelectReturningList $ select $ <query>
```

Let's select all the tracks.

```haskell
withConnectionTutorial $ runSelectReturningList $ select $ all_ (track chinookDb)
```

For the rest of the guide, we will also show the generated SQL code for both
sqlite and postgres.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
all_ (track chinookDb)
```

## `WHERE` clause

We've seen how to use `all_` to select all rows of a table. Sometimes, you would
like to filter results based on the result of some condition. For example,
perhaps you would like to fetch all customers whose names start with "Jo". We
can filter over results using the `filter_` function.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
filter_ (\customer -> customerFirstName customer `like_` "Jo%") $
all_ (customer chinookDb)
```

You can use `(&&.)` and `(||.)` to combine boolean expressions, as you'd expect.
For example, to select all customers whose first name begins with "Jo", last
name begins with "S", and who live in either California or Washington:

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
filter_ (\customer -> ((customerFirstName customer `like_` "Jo%") &&. (customerLastName customer `like_` "S%")) &&.
                      (addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "CA" ||. addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "WA")) $
        all_ (customer chinookDb)
```

!!! note "Note" 
    We had to use the `just_` function above to compare
    `addressState (customerAddress customer)`. This is because `addressState
    (customerAddress customer)` represents a nullable column which beam types as
    `Maybe Text`. Just as in Haskell, we need to explicitly unwrap the `Maybe`
    type. This is an example of beam offering stronger typing than SQL itself.

## `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` support

The `limit_` and `offset_` functions can be used to truncate the result set at a
certain length and fetch different portions of the result. They correspond to
the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` SQL constructs.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
limit_ 10 $ offset_ 100 $
filter_ (\customer -> ((customerFirstName customer `like_` "Jo%") &&. (customerLastName customer `like_` "S%")) &&.
                      (addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "CA" ||. addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "WA")) $
        all_ (customer chinookDb)
```

!!! note "Note"
    Nested `limit_`s and `offset_`s compose in the way you'd expect without
    generating extraneous subqueries.
    
!!! warning "Warning"
    Note that the order of the `limit_` and `offset_` functions matter.
    Offseting an already limited result is not the same as limiting an offseted
    result. For example, if you offset three rows into a limited set of five
    results, you will get at most two rows. On the other hand, if you offset
    three rows and then limit the result to the next five, you may get up to
    five. Beam will generate exactly the query you specify. Notice the
    difference below, where the order of the clauses made beam generate a query
    that returns no results.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
offset_ 100 $ limit_ 10 $
filter_ (\customer -> ((customerFirstName customer `like_` "Jo%") &&. (customerLastName customer `like_` "S%")) &&.
                      (addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "CA" ||. addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "WA")) $
        all_ (customer chinookDb)
```

Backends often differ as to how they implement LIMIT/OFFSET. For example, SQLite
requires that `LIMIT` always be given if an `OFFSET` is provided. Beam correctly
handles this behavior.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
offset_ 100 $
filter_ (\customer -> ((customerFirstName customer `like_` "Jo%") &&. (customerLastName customer `like_` "S%")) &&.
                      (addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "CA" ||. addressState (customerAddress customer) ==. just_ "WA")) $
        all_ (customer chinookDb)
```

Notice that the SQLite query output has provided a dummy `LIMIT -1` clause,
while the Postgres query has not.

## `DISTINCT` support

SQL can only return unique results from a query through the `SELECT DISTINCT`
statement. Beam supports this using the `nub_` command. For example, to get all
the unique postal codes where our customers live.

!beam-query
```haskell
!chinook sqlite3
!chinookpg postgres
nub_ $ fmap (addressPostalCode . customerAddress) $
  all_ (customer chinookDb)
```
